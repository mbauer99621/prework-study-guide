# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a Prework study guide webpage to help refresh me on HTML, GIT, JavaScript, and CSS. I build this project to prepare myself to begin bootcamp and to remember syntax of these different languages. This will help solve the problem of being a bit out of practice since my graduation was in Spring and I have not been doing much web designing since then. Through this project, I learned how github works a bit more than I had known previously.
